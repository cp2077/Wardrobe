# Wardrobe

## Description:

Save your outfits and put them on any time you want. Even in photo mode.

Outfits are shared across different save files and playthroughs.

## Installation:

1. Make sure you've installed Cyber Engine Tweaks.
2. Drop the content of an archive into your cyberpunk directory (where the "bin" folder is).

## Limitations:

1. You can't put outfits on when you are in inventory, because Cyberpunk has severe performance issues and glitches when it comes to managing your clothes. Maybe it will change later.
2. You can't wear something you don't own.
3. You can't wear outfits meant for the opposite gender.
